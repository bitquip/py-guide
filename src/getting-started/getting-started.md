# Getting Started

#### Installing Python

There is a possibility that Python is already installed on your machine. To check, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS, Linux) and type `python --version`. If you see a version number printed on the screen, you're good to go!

Otherwise, you'll need to install Python on your machine.

At Vizient, installing software on your machine requires admin privileges. If you don't have admin privileges, or do not know how to install things using your elevated (t1) account, then you will need to use an application included on your machine named "Company Portal". This application will allow you to install software on your machine without admin privileges.

Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type `Company Portal`. You should see an application named "Company Portal" appear in the search results. Click on it to open the application.

Once the application is open, click on the `Software` tab on the left side of the window. Search for `Python`, and click on the "Install" button. This will install Python on your machine.

#### Choosing a Code Editor

You'll need a code editor to write and run your Python code. There are several options available, and you can choose based on your preferences:

- **Visual Studio Code:** A popular and powerful code editor with a wide range of extensions for Python development.
- **PyCharm:** A comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for Python development.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing.

In the next section, we'll set up your development environment.

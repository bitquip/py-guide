# Basic Syntax and Data Types

Welcome to the **Basic Syntax and Data Types** section! In this section, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of Python programming. We'll cover variables, data types, and basic operations.

### Hello, World!

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program. This simple program prints a message to the screen.

```python
# Hello, World!
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Variables and Data Types

Variables are used to store data in a program. In Python, you don't need to explicitly declare a variable's type; Python infers it based on the assigned value.

```python
# Variables and Data Types
name = "Guyver"       # A string
age = 25            # An integer
height = 5.11       # A floating-point number
is_student = True   # A boolean

# Basic Operations
sum = 10 + 5                          # Addition
concatenation = "Hello, " + "world!"  # String concatenation
```

### Comments

Comments are used to explain code and make it more understandable for yourself and others. In Python, comments start with the `#` symbol.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line
comment.
"""
```

### Printing and Formatting

You've seen how to use `print()` to display text. You can also use formatting to include variables in your output.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
```

### Input from User

To get input from the user, you can use the `input()` function.

```python
name = input("What's your name? ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

In the next section, we'll delve into control flow with conditional statements and loops. Feel free to experiment with the code examples provided here.

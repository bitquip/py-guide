# Control Flow

Here, we'll learn how to make decisions and repeat tasks using conditional statements and loops.

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions. The `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords are used for this purpose.

```python
age = 18

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age >= 18 and age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

```python
name = "Michael Faraday"

if name == "Michael Faraday":
    print("The SI unit for electrical capacitance is named in honor of you!")
elif name == "RenÃ© Descartes":
    print("Ever heard of Cartesian coordinates? Mind/Body Dualism?")
else:
    print("Not sure who you are!")
```

### Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python offers two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

#### For Loop

```python
# Printing numbers from 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

#### While Loop

```python
age = 20
while age < 30:
    print("Age:", age)
    age += 1
```

### Break and Continue

You can use `break` to exit a loop prematurely and `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break     # Exit the loop when i is 5
    print(i)
```

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(i)
```

It should be noted there are built-in queue data types in Python for achieving different behavior:

- LIFO Queue: Last-In-First-Out data structure
- FIFO Queue: First-In-First-Out data structure

Both LIFO and FIFO queues are available and will be covered in the advanced section.

Understanding control flow is crucial for building complex programs. In the next section, we'll explore functions, which allow you to group code for reuse. If you're ready, let's proceed!

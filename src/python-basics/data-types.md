# Data Structures


Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. In this section, we'll explore some of the fundamental data structures in Python.

### Lists

A list is an ordered collection of items. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents.

```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Adding an item
fruits.append("orange")
```

### Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

```python
# Creating a tuple
coordinates = (10, 20)
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs, allowing you to associate values with unique keys.

```python
# Creating a dictionary
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}

# Accessing values using keys
print(person["name"])  # Outputs: Bob
```

### Sets

Sets are collections of unique elements. They are useful for eliminating duplicate values.

```python
# Creating a set
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}

# Adding elements to a set
unique_numbers.add(5)
```

Understanding these data structures is essential for efficient programming. In the next section, we'll explore modules and packages, which allow you to organize your code and use external libraries.
